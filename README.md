# GUI for Patient Monitor Prototype

## Description
This is an ongoing project that aims to develop a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) for a patient monitoring system prototype. The GUI is being designed to visualize vital signs data and facilitate real-time monitoring. The project is built using Python with the PyQt5 framework.

The current version of the project includes code and UI files that are being developed to interface with embedded systems for patient monitoring.

## Project Status
**Ongoing** â€“ This project is under active development. The goal is to create a functional and user-friendly interface for displaying patient vital signs, alarms, and other relevant data.

## Features
- Displays real-time vital signs data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 levels, etc.)
- Includes data graphs for easy visualization of patient status.
- Alarms for abnormal vital signs.
- Intuitive navigation between different screens.
- Local data logging (store vitals, alarms, and events to a local database)
- Query & filter historical records by patient, time range, or parameter
- Data export to CSV/Excel for offline analysis
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for developing the application.
- **PyQt5**: Framework for building the GUI.
- **Qt Designer**: Tool used for designing the `.ui` files, which are later converted to Python code.
- **SQL & Database (Local Storage)**: SQLite for embedded, zero-config local storage (default), Simple migration/init scripts to create tables and indexes
